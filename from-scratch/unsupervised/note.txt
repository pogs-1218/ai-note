Clustering
make groups

Applications of clustering
- Grouping similar news
- Market segmentation
- DNA analysis
- Astronomical data analysis

Clustering algorithm
---
K-means
1. Randomly choose two points(cluster centroids)
2. Assign every points to its closest centroids
3. Recompute the centroids 
4. repeat 2 ~ 3

Algorithm
Randomly initialize K cluster centroids [mu[0], mu[1], ... mu[k-1]]
Repeat {
# Assign ponts to cluster centroids
  for i = 1 to m
    c[i] = index(1tok) of cluster centroids closest to x[i]
    # use vector norm
# Move cluster centroids
  for k=1 to K
    mu[k] = average(mean) of points assigned to cluster k
}

Optimization
Objective
J = (1/m)*(sum(distance(x[i], m[c[i]])**2))

Initializing K-means
Coose K < m
Randomly pick K training examples
Set mu[0],...,mu[k-1] equal to these K examples

Proper intializing and choosing cluster centroids is important.
In order to find a good centroids,choose centroids randomly but with calculating the cost function in a loop.
Pick the best centroids!

Right value of K?
2 or 4? how many?

Elbow method
- Calculate cost functions on each number of clusters.
