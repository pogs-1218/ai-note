Clustering
make groups

Applications of clustering
- Grouping similar news
- Market segmentation
- DNA analysis
- Astronomical data analysis

Clustering algorithm
---
K-means
1. Randomly choose two points(cluster centroids)
2. Assign every points to its closest centroids
3. Recompute the centroids 
4. repeat 2 ~ 3

Algorithm
Randomly initialize K cluster centroids [mu[0], mu[1], ... mu[k-1]]
Repeat {
# Assign ponts to cluster centroids
  for i = 1 to m
    c[i] = index(1tok) of cluster centroids closest to x[i]
    # use vector norm
# Move cluster centroids
  for k=1 to K
    mu[k] = average(mean) of points assigned to cluster k
}

Optimization
Objective
J = (1/m)*(sum(distance(x[i], m[c[i]])**2))

Initializing K-means
Coose K < m
Randomly pick K training examples
Set mu[0],...,mu[k-1] equal to these K examples

Proper intializing and choosing cluster centroids is important.
In order to find a good centroids,choose centroids randomly but with calculating the cost function in a loop.
Pick the best centroids!

Right value of K?
2 or 4? how many?

Elbow method
- Calculate cost functions on each number of clusters.

Anomaly detection
---
Finding unusual events

Is x_test(new dataset) anomalous?
Density estimation
probability of x being seen in dataset

Gaussian(normal) distribution
---
mean(mu) and variance(sigma squared)
Probability of x is determined by a Gaussian with mean, variance
mu = avg(X) = (1/m)*sum(x[i])
sigma_squared = (1/m)*sum((x[i]-mu)**2)
-> by now, x is single number(1 feature)
  -> how about multipl feature, more than 1?

Abnomaly detection algorithm
---
X = np.array((m, n))
p(X) = p(x[1];mu[1],sigma[1]**2) * p(x[2];mu[2],sigma[2]**2) *...* p(x[n];mu[n],sigma[n]**2)

Algorithm evalutation
- Fit model on training set
- On a cross validation/text example x, predict


Anomaly detection vs supervised learning
when to use?
Anomaly detection
- very small number of positive examples(y=1)
- large number of negative examples(y=0)
- many different types
- unseen(new) positive data for future

supervised learning
- large number of positive and negative examples.
- seen dataset for future


Choosing what features to use
- if Non-gaussian features
 : Convert dataset to satifsfy Gaussian!
